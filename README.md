# Personal Web Portfolio

A personal website that showcases some of the work I have done so far. I have collaborated with groups to create projects as well as completed projects of my own. 

My Personal Web Development Portfolio includes:

* Name, photo and title 
* Navigation with page section links
* About me section
* Work section displaying completed projects
* Responsive layout

# Technologies used

In this project I have used HTML and CSS to create a simple website to display my work.
